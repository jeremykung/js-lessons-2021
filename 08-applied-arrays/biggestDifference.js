/*

Create a function that checks an array and finds the biggest difference between numbers

1. Your function should accept an array as a method
2. It should check for what the lowest number is
3. Then it should check for what the highest number is
4. It will then calculate the difference between those numbers and return the difference

Example
If your array is [12, 5, 2, 18, 15]
Your return value should be 16

Good luck!
